# Breast Cancer Survival Analysis – Data Analysis Project
**Author:** Nikolaos Tzouras  
**Date:** September 2025  

## About this Project
This project analyzes breast cancer patient data to explore factors affecting survival. Key variables include Age, Tumor Size, Stage, and Treatment Type. The analysis demonstrates survival analysis techniques such as Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.

**Note:** The code and report are written in **Greek**.

## Key Highlights
- Older patients and those with advanced tumor stages show lower survival rates.  
- Certain treatments are associated with improved survival outcomes.  
- Demonstrates use of survival analysis methods and interpretable visualizations.

## Files Included
- `Breast Cancer Survival Analysis.Rmd` → RMarkdown source with all code and commentary (in Greek)  
- `Breast-Cancer-Survival-Analysis.html` → Full report viewable in any browser  
- `breast_cancer_survival.csv` → Dataset used for analysis  
- `Dataset creation code.txt` → Code used to generate the dataset  

## Tools & Methods
- R packages: survival, survminer, dplyr, ggplot2  
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations  
- Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests  
- Cox proportional hazards regression modeling  

## How to Explore
Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio to see the analysis and run the code, or view the `.html` report in a browser to see the results and visualizations. Dataset and creation code are included for reproducibility.

This project highlights my ability to handle clinical data, perform survival analysis in R, and produce clear, interpretable visualizations.
